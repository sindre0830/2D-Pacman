#+TITLE: Assignment 1: Pacman

* Introduction

In this assignment each group is going to program a Pacman game in C++ with
OpenGL. The core concepts needed to achieve this are:

- Primitive Drawing with OpenGL.
- Vertex/Fragment shaders with GLSL.
- Vertex specification with OpenGL.
- Transformations with OpenGL and glm.
- Texturing with OpenGL.
- Window/Context management with GLFW and GLEW.
- Project generation / build system (e.g., CMake, Premake).

The game should follow the conventional gameplay principles of character
navigation in a maze, collection of pellets along the way and avoiding ghosts.

* Evaluation

The *deadline* for the assignment is *October 6th 11:59pm* (strict).

This assignment is worth *10%* (all the requirements) of the total grade for the course with up to 5%
extra points (optional features).

To be considered for its evaluation, the program must configure (if relevant),
build and run properly in machines with:

- Recent compiler (Visual studio 2019 or GCC > 9.0).
- Recent OpenGL (>= 4.3).
- If relevant, recent CMake (>= 3.12)
- Recent GLFW (>= 3.3.2)
- Recent GLEW (>= 2.1.0)
- C++ >= 11.

In addition to functionality, we will put considerable weight on the professionalism of your solution.

- Modularity: Code should be organised by functionality and reusability, and make use of header files to specify the externally available functionality. Be clear about your decisions, especially whenever your code design deviates from the above-mentioned principles (e.g., for performance/memory reasons, etc.).
- Versioning: Use proper version practice. Commit early and often. You will work in teams, which makes frequent commits important in order to avoid merge conflicts.
- Code as documentation: Make your code readable and add comments to clarify its function and purpose.

* Starting the Assignment

To start the development, *fork* (not clone) this repository into an own GitLab
area and work on that. Please ensure that all members of your group and the
teaching team have access to the forked repository. This way, we can easily
distribute additional code or modifications if necessary.


* Assignment submission

There is no explicit submission. Instead, we will assume that the code basis provided at the given repository URLs is complete at the given deadline. We will assess your code in a dedicated class session, both to let you explain its inner workings to us, as well as to give you direct feedback.
Before submission, please ensure:

 - your repository URL is correct (and visible),
 - your group allocations are up to date at the time of submission
 - your code compiles and runs. We will not mark code that does not compile! You
   should provide instructions on how to run in the README file that is part of
   the forked repository.

* Requirements

* Scenario

- The program must be able to load the scenario provided in the `levels/level0`
  file of this repository. In this file 1s refer to walls, 0s refer to tunnels
  and 2 refer to the initial position of /Pacman/.

- The program must display the scenario using the maximum possible area of the
  window allocated for it *and* respecting the aspect ratio of the map.

- The program must display the *tunnel* areas in the same color as the background
  color (up to the group to choose). The *walls* areas must have a different
  color than the background (up to the group to choose).

* Pellets

- The program must place and display /pellets/ (pearls or balls) in tunnel
  areas. The color of the pellets must be different than the colors of the
  background and walls. Pellets have all the same size, but the shape needs to
  be symmetrical (e.g, square, diamond, circle);

- Pellets dissapear (visually) when /Pacman/ passes over them.

* Pacman

- The program must place and display a /Pacman/ character that moves *only*
  inside the tunnel areas (it does not traverse walls). Pacman should be
  animated using the sprite sheet provided in `assets/pacman.png`.

- Movement of /Pacman/ can be directed by the player using the /arrow keys/ (up,
  down, left, right). Pacman cannot move outside the map.

* Ghosts

- The program must place and display /Ghosts/ (number of /ghosts/ decided by the
  group) characters which move *only* inside the /tunnel/ areas (/Ghosts/ do
  not traverse walls). The movement of the /Ghosts/ can be random throughout the
  game. The /Ghosts/ should be animated using the sprite sheet provided in
  `assets/pacman.png`. The initial position of the /ghosts/ should be random.

* Game mechanics

- The game ends when (1) there are no more /pellets/ on the screen or (2) when
  /pacman/ collides with any of the /Ghosts/. Ending the game will freeze the
  screen.
- The application terminates when the user presses the `Escape` key.

* Optional Features

 - *Beautiful Pellets:* represent the pellets as cicles with /anti-aliasing/.
 - *Smart Ghosts:* provide the /Ghosts/ with AI to follow /Pacman/.
 - *Scoring System:* design a scoring system that will be displayed during the
   progress game (on the same screen as the scenario, do not use extra windows).
 - *Magic Pellets:* make some of the /pellets/ magic by visually increasing
   the size. The number of magic pellets and their positioning in the map is up
   to the grouop. When /Pacman/ eats any of these pellets will acquire the power
   to eat /ghosts/. The /ghosts/ eaten will be removed from the game.
 - *Resizable screen:* make the screen resizable. The content should adapt to
   fit the screen. Add an option for full-screen.
 - *Be creative*: any feature improving the game in terms of experience,
   usability, look-and-feel can potentially be considered as extra feature
   (consult first with the teaching team).
